## Generate Pieces Using AI

You can use the CLI to generate a piece with its authentication and actions. The CLI supports OpenAPI specifications in both JSON and YAML formats.

### From OpenAPI URL

You can get an OpenAPI specification URL from sources like [apis.guru](https://apis.guru/?q=slack). Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

```bash
AP_OPENAI_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY npm run cli pieces scale https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/slack.com/1.7.0/openapi.json
```

### From a Static File

You can also supply an OpenAPI specification from a file path:

```bash
npm run cli pieces scale openAPIs/trello.json
```

<Tip>  
**Note:** You will find your generated piece under /packages/pieces/community/piece-name  
</Tip>  

> The last command expects that you are storing openAPIs/trello.json in the root directory of the activepieces repository.
